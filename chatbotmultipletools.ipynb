       "  'content': '2024 ended on a high note for open-source AI with Meta’s Llama models gaining traction. Since then, the open-source AI ecosystem has grown a lot, with smaller, domain-specific models achieving impressive results—it’s the case for IBM’s Granite, Ai2’s Olmo 3 and, of course, DeepSeek’s models. Anthony Annunziata, Director of Open Source AI at IBM and the AI Alliance, sees this trend accelerating in 2026.\\n\\n“We’re going to see smaller reasoning models that are multimodal and easier to tune for specific domains,” he said during an interview with IBM Think. [...] After much skepticism around AI’s ROI, AI capabilities will pave new ways to do business in the enterprise. And open-source reasoning models and agents will keep pushing boundaries to conquer enterprise AI.\\n\\nAt the same time, trust and security will become key priorities as many enterprises sharpen their focus on AI sovereignty.\\n\\nThat’s just the opening act for what’s to come in enterprise tech in the days ahead.

For him, multimodal AI is a trend he expects to see more of in 2026.\\n\\n“These models will be able to perceive and act in a world much more like a human. They’ll be able to bridge language, vision and action, all together,” he said. “In the near future, we’re to start seeing these multimodal digital workers that can autonomously complete these different tasks to interpret things, maybe even like complex healthcare cases.”',\n",

       "AIMessage(content='AI stands for Artificial Intelligence, which refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. The term may also be applied to any machine that exhibits traits associated with a human mind such as learning and problem-solving.\\n\\nAI technology is based on the principle of creating algorithms and statistical models that enable computers to process data, make decisions, and improve their performance over time. This is often achieved through machine learning (ML) techniques, which involve training the AI system using large amounts of data to enable it to learn from experience and make predictions or decisions.\\n\\nThere are several types of AI, including:\\n\\n1. **Narrow or Weak AI**: This type of AI is designed to perform a specific task, such as playing chess, recognizing faces, or translating languages. Narrow AI is trained on a specific dataset and is not capable of general reasoning or problem-solving.\\n2. **General or Strong AI**: This type of AI is designed to perform any intellectual task that a human can. General AI is still in the early stages of development and is not yet available.\\n3. **Superintelligence**: This type of AI is far superior to human intelligence and has the potential to solve complex problems and make decisions that are beyond human capabilities.\\n\\nSome common applications of AI include:\\n\\n1. **Virtual Assistants**: AI-powered virtual assistants, such as Siri, Alexa, and Google Assistant, can perform tasks such as scheduling appointments, sending messages, and playing music.\\n2. **Image Recognition**: AI-powered image recognition systems can identify objects, people, and scenes in images and videos.\\n3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: AI-powered NLP systems can process and understand human language, enabling applications such as language translation, text summarization, and chatbots.\\n4. **Predictive Analytics**: AI-powered predictive analytics systems can analyze data to predict outcomes, such as customer churn, stock prices, and disease diagnosis.\\n5. **Robotics**: AI-powered robots can perform tasks such as assembly, welding, and navigation.\\n\\nThe benefits of AI include:\\n\\n1. **Improved Efficiency**: AI can automate repetitive tasks, freeing up human resources for more complex and creative work.\\n2. **Enhanced Decision-Making**: AI can analyze large amounts of data to provide insights and recommendations for decision-making.\\n3. **Increased Accuracy**: AI can perform tasks with greater accuracy and speed than humans, reducing errors and improving productivity.\\n4. **Personalization**: AI can provide personalized experiences and recommendations for customers and users.\\n\\nHowever, AI also raises concerns and challenges, such as:\\n\\n1. **Job Displacement**: AI may displace human jobs, particularly those that involve repetitive or routine tasks.\\n2. **Bias and Discrimination**: AI systems can perpetuate biases and discrimination if they are trained on biased data or designed with discriminatory algorithms.\\n3. **Security Risks**: AI systems can be vulnerable to cyber attacks and data breaches, which can compromise sensitive information and disrupt operations.\\n4. **Ethical Concerns**: AI raises ethical concerns, such as accountability, transparency, and the potential for AI to be used for malicious purposes.\\n\\nOverall, AI has the potential to revolutionize the way we live and work, but it also requires careful consideration and management to ensure that its benefits are realized while minimizing its risks and challenges.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 666, 'prompt_tokens': 38, 'total_tokens': 704, 'completion_time': 0.912314353, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.00252227, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.04582221, 'total_time': 0.914836623}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f757f4b0bf', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c5608-67e9-7171-b167-72e3d07576b7-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 38, 'output_tokens': 666, 'total_tokens': 704})"

Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will form a black hole. The boundary of no escape is called the event horizon. In general relativity, a black hole's event horizon seals an object's fate but produces no locally detectable change when crossed. General relativity also predicts that every black hole shou\n",

      "[{\"title\": \"NASA's Chandra Finds Black Hole With Tremendous Growth\", \"url\": \"https://www.nasa.gov/missions/chandra/nasas-chandra-finds-black-hole-with-tremendous-growth/\", \"content\": \"While the same team discovered it two years ago, it took observations from Chandra in 2023 to discover what sets this quasar, RACS J0320-35, apart. The X-ray data reveal that this black hole appears to be growing at a rate that exceeds the normal limit for these objects.\\n\\n“It was a bit shocking to see this black hole growing by leaps and bounds,” said Luca Ighina of the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonian in Cambridge, Massachusetts, who led the study. [...] To figure out how fast this black hole is growing (between 300 and 3,000 Suns per year), the researchers compared theoretical models with the X-ray signature, or spectrum, from Chandra, which gives the amounts of X-rays at different energies. They found the Chandra spectrum closely matched what they expected from models of a black hole growing faster than the Eddington limit. Data from optical and infrared light also supports the interpretation that this black hole is packing on weight faster than the Eddington limit allows.\\n\\n“How did the universe create the first generation of black holes?” said co-author Thomas of Connor, also of the Center for Astrophysics. “This remains one of the biggest questions in astrophysics and this one object is helping us chase down the answer.” [...] The black hole weighs about a billion times the mass of the Sun and is located about 12.8 billion light-years from Earth, meaning that astronomers are seeing it only 920 million years after the universe began. It is producing more X-rays than any other black hole seen in the first billion years of the universe.\\n\\nThe black hole is powering what scientists call a quasar, an extremely bright object that outshines entire galaxies. The power source of this glowing monster is large amounts of matter funneling around and entering the black hole.\", \"score\": 0.9961755}, {\"title\": \"New method could reveal hidden supermassive black hole binaries\", \"url\": \"https://www.mpg.de/26071110/0129-grav-new-method-could-reveal-hidden-supermassive-black-hole-binaries-152520-x\", \"content\": \"Supermassive black holes reside at the centers of most galaxies. When two galaxies collide and merge, their central black holes eventually form a bound pair, known as a supermassive black hole binary. These systems play a crucial role in galaxy evolution and are among the most powerful sources of gravitational waves in the Universe. While future space-based gravitational-wave observatories like LISA will be able to probe such binaries directly, researchers are now showing that they may already be detectable using existing and upcoming electromagnetic surveys.\\n\\n## Gravitational lensing [...] A black circle in the center is surrounded by a faint ring, with bright red-orange curved lines visible on a grey backdrop, indicating light distortion.

As the binary inspirals, gravitational-wave emission subtly alters the caustic structure, imprinting a characteristic modulation in both the frequency and peak brightness of the flashes. By measuring these patterns, astronomers could infer key properties of the underlying black hole binary, including its masses and orbital evolution. As they orbit each other under the influence of gravity, they slowly lose energy through the emission of gravitational waves. This also reduces the distance between the two black holes.

The supermassive black holes at the heart of galaxies, even when seemingly dormant, exert a powerful, quiet influence. This latest research, powered by the vision of JWST, provides detailed measurements that paint a clearer picture of their ionizing continuum and kinetic feedback processes.\\n\\nWe have learned these cosmic engines actively sculpt their surroundings, impacting star formation and galactic evolution. The discovery of unusually warm molecular hydrogen in these LLAGN is a testament to the unexpected complexity hiding in plain sight. It is a reminder that the universe always has more to teach us. [...] The black hole also actively pushes and stirs the galactic gas and dust. It is not a passive bystander. This can clear out regions, stopping new stars from forming, or sometimes compress gas, triggering a burst of star formation. It's a complex dance these quiet engines perform regularly. A striking discovery is that these galaxies with LLAGN have unusually warm molecular hydrogen gas. Excitation temperatures are systematically higher than in other galaxies. This suggests that even an idling black hole can really heat its surroundings.\\n\\nBreaking space news, the latest updates on rocket launches, skywatching events and more! [...] This research is just one piece of a much larger puzzle. It opens up new questions about how common this warm molecular hydrogen is. It also prompts scientists to consider what other subtle effects these quiet black holes might have.

Under the agreement, Tesco will gain full access to Mistral’s commercial AI models and collaborate with its engineers through a new joint “AI lab.” The initiative aims to improve customer service, support staff workflows, accelerate data analysis, and create practical generative AI solutions tailored to retail operations. Tesco’s Data, Analytics & AI Director emphasized that the collaboration blends the retailer’s market experience with Mistral’s technology to drive efficiency and better serve customers and colleagues.\\n\\nSource:AI News [...] Summary: A new study from Microsoft Research, detailed in Fortune, identifies the specific career paths most \\\"exposed\\\" to the next wave of generative AI and autonomous agents. The research suggests that high-skill, white-collar roles, particularly those in finance, legal services, and software engineering, face the highest degree of task automation. Unlike previous industrial shifts that impacted manual labor, this AI wave is increasingly capable of performing complex cognitive tasks such as contract analysis, code debugging, and financial forecasting. Microsoft researchers emphasize that \\\"exposure\\\" does not necessarily mean total job replacement, but rather a fundamental restructuring of daily responsibilities where workers must adapt to collaborating with AI to remain competitive. [...] Summary: A former Google software engineer has been convicted on multiple counts of trade secret theft after a federal investigation revealed he illicitly transferred over 500 confidential files related to Google’s proprietary artificial intelligence infrastructure. The stolen data included critical details on \\\"TPU\\\" (Tensor Processing Unit) chips and software used to power large-scale machine learning models. Prosecutors established that the engineer was secretly working for two China-based technology companies while still employed at Google, using the stolen information to help those firms gain a competitive edge in the global AI race.
